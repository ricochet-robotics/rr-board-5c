This is a pretty Ricochet Robots board written by Keith
Packard in Nickle. It is part of the Ricochet Robotics
project (http://github.com/ricochet-robotics).  As far as I
can tell, the board has not yet been hooked up to the
server, so it cannot yet be used for multiplayer games.

To build, "sh autogen.sh". To install "make install" with
appropriate permissions. The executable is called
"ricochet".
